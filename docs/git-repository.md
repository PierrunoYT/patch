# Git repository adapter

Patch delegates repository semantics to the installed Git CLI rather than
reimplementing them. `discoverCommonGitRoot` asks Git for each selected path's
worktree, using the nearest existing parent for files that have not been created
yet. It returns one canonical worktree root and rejects a mixture of independent
repositories or repository and non-repository paths.

This behavior is adapted from aider's repository initialization in
[`aider/repo.py`](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/blob/5dc9490bb35f9729ef2c95d00a19ccd30c26339c/aider/repo.py),
modified to use async `git` subprocesses and canonical Node.js paths. It is also
used by staged configuration bootstrap when selected files correct the initial
working-directory root.
